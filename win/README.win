Sybtcl for Windows

BEFORE YOU BEGIN

Sybtcl has been ported to Windows NT & 95.
It has been tested with the latest version of Tcl, 8.0.5.  

You must also have a working Sybase client installation on your machine,
as Sybtcl uses Sybase DLLs, notably 'libsybdb.dll'.


INSTALLING SYBTCL FOR WINDOWS

Easy install:
 
I've written a tiny install script.  It figures out which of the two
DLLs to install based on your Tcl version, copies that file to your
Tcl library, makes a pkgIndex.tcl and installs it into a project directory.
First, copy all files in this directory to some directory on your Windows
PC.  e.g., c:\sybtcl

To install, copy ALL of the files in the Sybtcl ./win directory to your PC, 
and simply run the install.tcl file with your tclsh:
 
	tclsh80 install.tcl
        answer 'yes' when prompted.
 
Manual installation instructions:

1.  Install Sybase Open Client for Windows.  Make sure you can run
    sybping and isql to connect to your databases.
    Sybtcl depends on libsybdb.dll, so this must be installed, usually in 
    your windows system directory.  Make sure that your
    Sybase DLLs are in your path set by 'autoexec.bat' (Windows95) or in your
    environment via the 'System' control panel (WindowsNT).  
    You should also have the enviroment variable 'SYBASE' pointing to
    your Sybase installation directory.  Sybtcl can work with either
    Sybase System 10 or 11 client libraries.

2.  Copy the sybtcl.dll to your Tcl .\lib directory.  
    
    copy sybtcl3080.dll  c:\program files\tcl\lib\sybtcl30.dll


3.  Copy or add pkgIndex.tcl to your Tcl lib directory.  This is so
    the 'package unknown' scripts can resolve the 'package ifneeded' to
    load the dll.  
    
    The 'install.tcl' script makes a directory adjacent to your Tcl lib
    called 'sybtcl30', and creates the pkgIndex.tcl there.

    mkdir c:\program files\tcl\lib\sybtcl30
    copy pkgIndex.tcl c:\program files\tcl\lib\sybtcl30

4.  Try it out!

    c:\> tclsh80
    % package require Sybtcl
    3.0 
    % set h [sybconnect id password SERVER]
    sybtcl0
    % sybsql $h .....whatever....

    If you get errors:

    If 'package require' says it can't find package Sybtcl:
	    -make sure you've installed the pkgIndex.tcl.
	    -or just load the sybtcl.dll manually
		    % load "c:/program files/tcl/lib/sybtcl30.dll"
		    (or wherever you put it)
    If 'sybconnect' complains about resolving symbols:
	    -make sure you have the Sybase Open Client libraries installed
	     and on the PATH

    If 'sybconnect' fails in dbopen(), then you have a bad id, password,
    or server definition.  Make sure you can connect to your database using
    isql. 


RUNNING TESTS
    
You can run the Sybtcl tests manually by:
        Start tclsh80   (or appropriate version)
          cd to_your_sybtcl_tests_directory
          source all
 
        You will also need to enter a vaild Sybase id, password, server,
        and database that you have permission to create tables and 
        stored procedures. 


BUILDING SYBTCL FOR WINDOWS

My development environment is:
	Windows 95
	Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0
	Tcl 8.0.5 for Windows
	Sybase Open Client for Windows 11.5 (works with Sybase 10.0.3+ libs)


1.  Get and unpack the Tcl 8.0.5 (or higher) distribution.  The 'binary'
    Tcl distribution contains the include and library files needed by
    Sybtcl.  Alternatively, you can get the full source Tcl distribution.

2.  Modify the makefile as needed.  You'll probably have to change the
    values for the TCL and SYBASE defines to suit.
    The compiler will need to find your Sybase include files, and the
    linker will need to find the libsybdb.lib file, as well as the
    Tcl include and lib files..

3.  Make it!  
	C:\sybtcl> nmake -f makefile.vc

4.  Install it as noted above.
